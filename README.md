# Disjoint-Vocab-word-merrium
For GRE/GMAT/TOEFL/IELTS preparation, we follow multiple word lists. Most of words are common in these lists. So when I completed a list (Barron's 333 high frequency) and opted for moving to another (Gregmat's 1000), I needed to list the new unique ones. That's what I did here, also fetched the meanings of the new list using merrium webster's API
